## Features

- **Smart Bedtime Zones**: Visual indication of your current bedtime status:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green Zone**: Time to get ready for bed
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Zone**: You should be in bed by now
  - ðŸ”´ **Red Zone**: You're significantly past bedtime

- **Customizable Sleep Schedule**:
  - Set your desired wake-up time
  - Configure your ideal sleep duration
  - Adjust zone durations to match your personal wind-down routine

- **Home Detection**:
  - Automatically detects when you're at home via Wi-Fi network
  - Only sends bedtime reminders when you're at home

- **Charging Detection**:
  - Monitors if your device is charging
  - Assumes you're sleeping if your device is charging during bedtime hours
  - Skips alarms when charging at bedtime (you're likely already asleep)

- **Engaging Alarm Dismissal**:
  - Solve a small puzzle to dismiss the alarm
  - Ensures you're actually awake before turning off the reminder

- **Persistent Notifications**:
  - Full-screen alerts that can appear even when your device is locked
  - Gradually increasing reminder frequency as bedtime zones progress

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Schedule**: Configure your wake-up time and desired sleep duration
2. **Zone Monitoring**: The app calculates your ideal bedtime and creates three zones:
   - Green Zone: The initial period when you should start preparing for bed
   - Yellow Zone: When you should be in bed
   - Red Zone: When you're significantly past your ideal bedtime
3. **Smart Reminders**: 
   - Reminders only trigger when you're at home (connected to your home Wi-Fi)
   - If your phone is charging during bedtime hours, the app assumes you're sleeping and won't disturb you
   - Reminders become more frequent as you progress through the zones
